1. Balloting For Corporate Governance: Modernization of rigid Annual General Meetings of Shareholders.

Problem with current system:

Current AGM’s system hinders fast and flexible decision making. For Example: If a new board of director needs to be selected for a company, they can’t  fill the position permanently without a majority vote of the shareholders.
Smaller Shareholders have less incentives to participate in physical AGM’s, since cost of voting can be higher than benefits of voting.

How Blockchain can work:
Corporations can hold ballots for any decisions requiring approval of shareholders at any time. This can make the corporation’s decision making fast and flexible. The ballots can be carried out with any constraints the corporation chooses to enforce such as:
    Ballots can be for a limited amount of time.
    The Weight of Vote can be equitable to the percentage of shares held.
    Can support proxy voting.
    Can reduce lobbying since the votes are truly anonymous.
    Smaller Shareholders can show improved level of participation.
    Reduces cost of holding AGM’s
